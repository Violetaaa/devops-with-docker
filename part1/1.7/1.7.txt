EXERCISE 1.7: IMAGE FOR SCRIPT
We can improve our previous solutions now that we know how to create and build a Dockerfile.

Let us now get back to Exercise 1.4.

Create a new file on your local machine with and append the script we used previously into that file:

while true
do
  echo "Input website:"
  read website; echo "Searching.."
  sleep 1; curl http://$website
done

Create a Dockerfile for a new image that starts from ubuntu:20.04 and add instructions to install curl into that image. Then add instructions to copy the script file into that image and finally set it to run on container start using CMD.

After you have filled the Dockerfile, build the image with the tag "curler".

If you are getting permission denied, use chmod to give permission to run the script.
The following should now work:

$ docker run -it curler

Remember that RUN can be used to execute commands while building the image!

Submit the Dockerfile.
