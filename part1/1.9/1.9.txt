EXERCISE 1.9: VOLUMES
In this exercise we won't create a new Dockerfile.

Image devopsdockeruh/simple-web-service creates a timestamp every two seconds to /usr/src/app/text.log when it's not given a command. Start the container with bind mount so that the logs are created into your filesystem.

Submit the command you used to complete the exercise.

***
-v option requires an absolute path. We mount our current folder as /usr/src/app/ in our container, overwriting everything that we have put in that folder in our Dockerfile.
